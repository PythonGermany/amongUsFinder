A fast and efficient script to search pixel art images for little amongi like from the reddit r/place 2022 event.

It is possible to process either single images or an image sequence named from 00000 to XXXXX.
It is also possible to process every "n"th image in the sequence e.g. n=2 == skip skip every 2nd picture in the sequence.
The program also outputs a txt file containing the number of amongi counted in every image of the sequence.

The output images can be processed into a video file with other software. The results for the r/place 2022 event are something like this: https://youtu.be/mVmTI0B95Kk
