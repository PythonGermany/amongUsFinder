A fast and efficient script to search pixel art images for little amongi like from the reddit r/place 2022 event.

Use image sequence: [program name].exe [source path] [destination path] [start index] [stop index] [index step]
Use single image: [program name].exe [source file]

It is possible to process either single images or an image sequence named from 00000 to XXXXX.
It is also possible to process every "n"th image in the sequence e.g. n=2 == skip skip every 2nd picture in the sequence.
The program also outputs a txt file containing the number of amongi counted in every image of the sequence.

The output images can be processed into a video file with other software. The results for the r/place 2022 event are something like this: https://youtu.be/mVmTI0B95Kk
