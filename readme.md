# A fast and efficient script to search pixel art images for little amongi e.g. for the reddit r/place 2022/23 event

* Use image sequence: [program name].exe [absolute source path] [absolute destination path] [start index] [stop index] [index step]
* Use single image: [program name].exe [source file]

It is possible to process either single images or an image sequence named from 00000 to XXXXX.<br />
It is also possible to process every n-th image in the sequence: index step=2 says use only every 2nd picture in the sequence.<br />
The program also outputs a txt file containing the number of amongi counted in every image of the sequence.

The output images can be processed into a video file with other software.<br />
